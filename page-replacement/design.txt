IN the main.cpp I implemented 

first FIFO then LRU at last I implemented OPT

In FIFO first I got values from the inp.txt then with using them i creted 
at first a array of size a (which will have value of no of frames)
then in b I am storing the page size

then using while loop i am getting the value of c which contains the present adress which we checking

then in while loop first i am checking if the new adress is already present if present i am leaving 
else i am seeing if all elements in a is full or not if full i am remving the first accessed item 
else i am adding it to the frame which is not used till now

Then in LRU also same for getting the values from the file named inp.txt

except that here if here while checking for a new adress if already present then i am shifting
the element which accesed now to the last of array by moving the elements

else same like did in the FIFO

Now lets come to OPT here I am first storing all valuues accessed for reading into 
a vector named v1 and from here using the technique taught in class for seeing the OPT 
by doing Brute Force

and finally printing the output of all faults into console if anny occured
