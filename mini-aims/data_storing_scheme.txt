This program stores all its data in the subfolder named DATA.


The data-storing scheme is as shown below:

1)Admins.txt stores the list of admins in IITH along with there passwords in the following manner.
<Admin1>
<pass1>
<Admin2>
<pass2>
.
.
so on.

2)faculty.txt stores the list of faculty in IITH along with there passwords similar to the scheme shown above.

3)students.txt stores the list of students admitted in IITH with there data stored according to the scheme shown below.
<student1_roll>
<student1_pass>
<student1_name>
<student1_branch>
<student1_program>

4)Each faculty has their own .txt file named after their name which stores the course_codes of the courses to which they are an instructor.
For example "Faculty1.txt" stores the codes to the courses to which Faculty1 is an instructor.

5)Each student has their own .txt files named after their roll_numbers which stores the courses they are enrolled to.
For example StudentA has the roll number roll1 and the file "roll1.txt" stores the courses to which he/she is enrolled.

6)Each course that is being floated or was floated has its own .txt file with the name of its course_code. This file stores the course_instructor name at the top and then stores the name of the students enrolled in it along with their grades.
For example a course with course_code "course1" will have a .txt file named "course1.txt" which would store data in the following way.
<course_instructor>
<enrolled_student_roll1>
<Not_Yet_Graded/Grade>
<enrolled_student_roll2>
<Grade>
